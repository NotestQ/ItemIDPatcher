# ItemIDPatcher
This preloader patches item entries and items themselves to use ints, making it possible to go over the 255 ID limit that was imposed.
The preloader comes alongside a plugin, making it possible for a mod to coexist with the IDPatcher

**ITEM MODS THAT DON'T SUPPORT THE IDPATCHER** ***WILL BREAK*** **IF IDPATCHER IS USED**

A very small write-up on how to add compatibility without hard depending on the mod and patched assembly is [in the wiki](https://github.com/NotestQ/ItemIDPatcher/wiki/How-to-add-compatibility)

## Credits
- [Day](https://github.com/wwwDayDream) for making some important patches, helping me understand Mono.Cecil (and a bit more of C# to be fair) and being overall patient!
