# ItemIDPatcher
This preloader is made to work specifically with CustomItemLibrary, which makes it easier to create custom items and/or add things to the base game's shop

## Credits
- [Day](https://github.com/wwwDayDream) for making some important patches, helping me understand Mono.Cecil (and a bit more of C# to be fair) and being overall patient!
